This analysis focuses on the year over year Citi Bike ridership amidst a pandemic.  We are looking specifically at the data for June 2019 and June 2020.  

On the first screen, you will see a comparison of ride counts.   While there was only an 11.44% drop in total ridership during the pandemic, there was a 25.44% reduction in rides from subscribers, while rides by non-subscribers (customers) increased by 54.38%.  You will also see a side-by-side comparison of average trip durations.  Overall, trip durations increased by 47.318%, with subscriber rides increasing by 42.62% and non-subscriber rides increasing by only 11.82%, though non-subscriber rides are longer on average than subscriber rides.  The first page also includes a map plotting all endpoints for subscriber and non-subscriber rides for both June 2019 and June 2020.  The filters give the option to show data for all user types or just one, and both years or just one.

The following page shows the top ten end points for all riders comparing June 2019 and June 2020, with a filter option to choose one or the other, or both.  The pie chart indicators, represent the change from year to year, and include a pop up with the name of the station, the year, and the count of riders.  

The idea for this analysis was to see if ridership in general, and certain stations were affected by Covid19.  While overall ridership reduced, there was a definite increase in non-subscriber use.  And although the top ten ending stations remained the same, only one station (Pier 40 â€“ Hudson river Park) saw an increase.
